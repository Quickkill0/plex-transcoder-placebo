# Move the downscale onto the GPU and ahead of the tone map.
#
# Plex decodes on the GPU but omits -hwaccel_output_format, so every 4K frame is copied to
# system memory and scaled there. Tone mapping then costs whatever libplacebo is handed, and
# handing it 4K is four times the work of 1080p. Measured, 4K->1080p, 335 frames:
#
#   sw scale + sw tonemap (Plex today)      17.6s wall  32.9s cpu
#   sw scale + libplacebo (in-place swap)   17.6s wall  18.0s cpu
#   scale_vaapi then libplacebo at 1080p    11.6s wall   4.2s cpu
#
# Note it's the scale ordering that pays, not skipping the download: leaving the scale to
# libplacebo and only avoiding the copy still took 18.2s. Downloading AFTER the GPU scale is
# cheap (1080p nv12 is ~8x smaller than 4K p010) and keeps Plex's software subtitle overlay
# working untouched downstream.
#
# Only the video chain may become scale_vaapi; the subtitle scale operates on software ARGB
# and would fail. The video chain is found by following the label that feeds the tone map,
# rather than by guessing from how the scale happens to be spelled.
